# Capstone Project

You show up to a board game meetup, excited to play some games. Perhaps you brought your own niche gem that you've been wanting to dive into since last Christmas. But alas, you show up, there's 80 people at this crowded board game meetup. 50 of them are new-ish and end up playing Codenames because it's the path of least resistance to get going. The other 30 might be decent, but half of them are part of some clique you haven't busted into in weeks. The few you finally gather to play with you end up eyes glazed over zoning out as you explain the rules to this game they have no interest in playing. That's where my app, GameStarter, comes in! Picture it like if Meetup and Kickstarter had a baby.

Choose a game you'd like to play, how many people you need, a time, and a location. You have until 24 hours before the start of your game to fund it with participation from other users. If you get enough players, your game happens! If not, the game is cancelled; no awkward meetup encounters or hard feelings!
